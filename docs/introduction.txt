Introduction
============

Motivation
----------

Why another configuration library? The simple answer is that none of the
available options gave me everything I wanted, with an API that I liked.
This library is as close to ideal as I have been able to come within the
limits of Python.

The result is not so different from the standard library's ConfigParser,
but allows me to avoid patching ConfigParser with the changes I find myself
making everytime I use it.

Features
--------

* Coercion - Automatic type parsing and serialization.
* Nested sections
* dict-like access
* Interpolation - Keys can be referenced within values.
