Quickstart
==========

A :class:`~config.Config` object can be used directly without any initialization::
    
    import config
    
    cfg = config.Config()
    cfg['server.host'] = '8.8.8.8'
    cfg['server.port'] = 8181

Configuration keys are :samp:`.` delimited strings where each preceding name
refers to a section, and the final name refers to a key with a value. In
the example above, `server` is a section name, while `host` and `port` are
keys within the section.

The configuration can then be serialized to various formats using the
:meth:`~config.Config.sync` method::

    cfg.sync('app.cfg')

After the call to :meth:`~config.Config.sync`, a new file with the following
contents will be created in the current working directory::

    server.host = 127.0.0.1
    server.port = 8080

The default output format is a simple list of "full.key = value" lines. The
format to use can be set either in the call to :meth:`~config.Config.sync` or
in the :class:`~config.Config` constructor.

Sources
-------

The sources a config object uses when it syncs can also be set in the
:class:`~config.Config` constructor::
    
    cfg = config.Config('app.cfg')

The `sources` argument can be either a single path, or a sequence of paths. In
the case of a sequence, a sync will first update the object with any values
that have changed in the sources but not in the object since the last sync.
Then it will write back any values changed in the object to the first source.

Initialization
--------------

On of the most useful features of the :mod:`config` module is the ability
to initialize the options that are expected to be set on a
:class:`~config.Config` object.

This can be done using the :meth:`~config.Config.init` method::
    
    cfg.init('server.host', '127.0.0.1')
    cfg.init('server.port', 8080, int)

The second argument to :meth:`~config.Config.init` specifies a default
value for the option. The third argument is optional and is used by the
:mod:`coerce` module to automatically (de)serialize any value that is set
for the option. If the third is not provided, the type of the default value
will be used to select the correct coercer.

If you were to `sync` the config file without initializing, all the values
would be set as string values. However, the :meth:`~config.Config.get` method
accepts a `type` argument that will apply a coercer directly.
